# Store Management System Using Multi-Layer ArchitectureðŸ“Š

## Introduction
The store management system is developed to optimize the management process of goods, transactions, personnel, and revenue reporting for retail stores. The system applies a multi-layer architecture to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C# (.NET Framework)
- **Database**: SQL Server 2019
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **UI Framework**: Windows Forms + Guna.UI2 Framework
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio 2022


The system is built using a **4-layer architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer (PL)**: User interface with Windows Forms
2. **Business Logic Layer (BL)**: Business logic processing
3. **Data Access Layer (DL)**: Database interactions
4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTO)**: Defines data exchange structures

  - `Category`: Product categories
  - `Customer`: Customer information
  - `Users`: System user management
  - `Sale`: Sales history
  - `Purchase`: Purchase management

## Installation & Running Instructions
